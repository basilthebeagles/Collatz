What is the Collatz conjecture?
===============================
The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in Maths(or "math" eww), that if you take any number above 1. And divide it by two if it is even and times it by three and then add 1 if it is odd you will eventually end up with 1.


[Here is a Wikipedia page that describes it in more detail](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture)
